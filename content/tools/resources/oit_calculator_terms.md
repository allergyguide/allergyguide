{% admonition(type="warning", icon="warning", title="PLAIN LANGUAGE") %}

**This tool is strictly for use by qualified medical physicians. It does not replace professional medical advice**. OIT involves strict safety parameters, up-dosing schedules, and reaction management plans that vary by patient and institution. OIT should always be done under direct medical supervision. **Attempting to use these calculations without physician supervision can lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis and other harms. Do not use this tool to self-treat.**

{% end %}

**By using this tool, you acknowledge that you are a qualified medical physician.**

This tool is provided for clinical calculation and documentation purposes only. **It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for independent clinical judgment**. All calculations, dose progressions, and transition thresholds generated by this tool must be interpreted, validated, and approved by a qualified healthcare professional prior to clinical use.

## Data Privacy and Local Processing

To ensure compliance with data privacy standards, the **clinical calculations and data processing** portions of this tool function **entirely as a client-side application**.

This tool is **_explicitly_** not intended to process any Patient Health Information (PHI) such as patient names, dates of birth, or medical record numbers. **Any PHI entered by the user into the tool is done so in violation of our Terms of Use and is at the user's own risk.**

- **Local Processing**: All calculations, including the "Undo/Redo" history stack, are processed and stored temporarily in your browser's memory. This data is cleared when you refresh the page.
- **No Server Transmission of Protocol Data (Standard Use)**: During standard calculation and PDF generation, data entered into tool input fields, custom notes, and your interaction history are never transmitted to our servers, analytics providers, or stored in external databases.
- **Voluntary Data Transmission (Save Requests)**: If you are an authorized user and choose to use the "Request to Save Protocol" feature, the specific protocol data, context notes, and your email address will be transmitted to our backend and email service provider (Resend) to notify our team of your request and provide a send receipt to your email.
  - **No PHI**: You explicitly agree NOT to include any PHI such as patient names, dates of birth, or medical record numbers in any fields of the save request.
- **User Authentication**: User authentication credentials (username/password) are transmitted securely to our backend solely for the purpose of verifying access permissions and retrieving authorized user-custom assets. These credentials are not used for any other purpose.
- **PDF Exports & QR Codes**: When generating a PDF, the file is created locally on your device. The PDF includes a QR code designed for technical debugging and verification. This QR code encodes the specific protocol parameters (e.g., food choices, target doses), the version of the tool used to make it, and a log of settings changes.
  - The QR code information explicitly excludes the "Custom Notes" field to minimize data exposure.
  - **User Responsibility**: You agree not to enter Patient Identifiers (names, DOBs) into any input field. **The tool is not intended to process ANY PHI.** You acknowledge that by downloading a PDF, you become the custodian of any data visible within it.

## User Accounts and Security

- **Access Credentials**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. You acknowledge that your account provides access to proprietary clinical assets licensed specifically for your use.
- **Unauthorized Use**: You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.

## Intellectual Property and Licensing

While the source code for this tool is Open Source (GPLv3), the **generated clinical assets** are subject to specific licensing restrictions to protect the integrity of the medical materials.

- **Source Code**: The underlying logic and code are licensed under **GPLv3**.
- **Select Generated PDFs and Handouts**: Some PDF handouts, protocols, or patient handouts downloaded through this tool contain "**Copyright © 2025 allergyguide**". These are **strictly proprietary**.
  - **Authorized Use**: These materials are licensed for use solely by you (the medical professional) for your direct clinical practice.
  - **No Redistribution**: You may NOT redistribute, resell, republish, or post these files on any public-facing website or repository.
